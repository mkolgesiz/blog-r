On the other hand, gradually add the agda prepared in another bowl to this mixture while it is still warm. When the halva, which thickens as it is mixed, reaches the desired consistency, remove it from the stove, crush it well in the sinis, spread it and cool it. The next day, it is blended with powdered sugar and a little salt to provide the desired sweetness and served in portions. If pistachios are to be added to the Tenem halva, they are added towards the end of the roasting process and roasted together, giving the halva a distinct appearance and flavor. Crushed cloves can also be added on top of the portions during serving."

    "text": "Windows 11 and Its Issues\nWindows 11 has become more bloated than ever. Even with paid products such as Microsoft Office, you can’t escape automatic updates and more. Even with 16 GB of RAM, the OS doesn’t run smoothly due to the many background processes. For me, the last straw was Microsoft showing their AI products in every single place they can imagine, namely Copilot. I use Excel on a daily basis. One day, the Copilot icon started to pop up in every single cell. It was more than annoying. Later that day, I decided to use Linux as an alternative and ordered a separate SSD.\n\n\nThe Installation process\nSince I didn’t know if I would be able to use it, I decided to install it on a separate SSD by following this YouTube video. It was relatively easy. I backed up my disk before the installation as a safeguard measure.\nAfter I successfully installed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, without doing anything else, I installed Omakub. (Thank you DHH!) It worked like magic. Honestly, I was a bit surprised. I tried Linux in the early 2000s and 2010s. Back then, you had to babysit the OS and spend several hours in forums just to update your PC drivers.\nThe only caveat was installing the R packages. But I was able to find an amazing GitHub repo and forum post to resolve any issues.\n\n\nImpressions\nSo far, I’m very positive about my transition. The OS just works. No frills, no babysitting. Also, I’m learning new things about the Linux environment from the open source community. Compared to Windows 11, the system runs more quietly and consumes fewer resources, especially RAM usage. There are also privacy benefits of using Linux as well.\nI highly recommend trying Linux for everyday use. For those who need special software for their business, dual boot options are also available, which I use on a regular basis. Give it a try!"

    "title": "E-Invoice Migration in Ivory Coast",
    "section": "What is FNE",
    "text": "What is FNE\nFNE is the centralized e-invoice platform created by Ivorian tax authorities. All companies are subject to the obligation to issue standardized electronic invoices, regardless of their size or status, unless explicitly exempted by law.\nBased on a company’s legal status, issuing invoices through the platform is mandatory starting from 2025-06-01. All entities are expected to use the platform starting from 2025-09-01.\n\nHow it works\nAll entities must register on the FNE platform. Entities need to purchase electronic stamps on the FNE platform for document validation. Once a document is validated, a QR code will appear on it, and it will be sent to the buyer’s FNE inbox. There are three ways to issue a document:\n\nUsing FNE platform\nAuthorized billing terminals\nBilling systems interfaced with the FNE platform via an API.\n\nEntities may use one of these methods above to issue e-invoice or e-receipts.\n\nUsing FNE platform\nThe principal user who registered the platform can register new users with desired authorization levels, create establishments, points of sale, and nomenclature. Electronic stamps for document validation are purchased via the FNE platform.\nThere are several constraints I’ve observed so far when using the FNE platform:\n\nYou cannot register to different companies with same e-mail address.\nYou cannot save a document if you haven’t created point of sales.\nRegistered user can issue documents for only one establishment and one point of sales at a time.\nSaved documents cannot be deleted.\nYou cannot choose the document date; the date defaults to the invoice validation date with a full time stamp.\n\nSeveral VAT types are missing.\n\n\n\nAuthorized billing terminals\nFor small and micro-businesses subject to a flat-rate system, as well as for companies subject to a real tax system that use cash registers, it is planned to use TERNE3 for invoicing. This equipment will enable the issuance of standardized electronic receipts.\n\nElectronic payment terminal4\nMobile app of RNE5\n\nAs of 01/06/2025, there is no official publication of authorized vendors for electronic payment terminals or mobile applications.\n\n\nBilling systems interfaced with the FNE platform via an API\nTax authority published an technical API documentation for ERP integration. Companies are allowed to build their own solution via API key. However, as of 01/06/2025 there is no official agreed integration solution vendor published.\nSo far, I found only one vendor who offers ERP integration. Dexy Africa offers integration solution for ERP systems such as Sage, ODOO and Microsoft Dynamics 365."
