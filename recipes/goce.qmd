## Ingredients

-   250g cracked wheat (bulgur-like texture, hulled wheat)
-   5 dried red chili peppers
-   Butter
-   Olive oil
-   Chicken or beef broth
-   1 head of garlic
-   Yogurt
-   Salt
-   1 tablespoon flour
-   2.5 cups water

## Directions

Start by washing the cracked wheat 5-6 times until the water runs clear. Place the wheat in a pot and add enough water to cover it, then bring to a boil. As it cooks, keep adding chicken or beef broth whenever the liquid gets low.

Once the wheat becomes tender, give it a quick blend to break it up a bit. When the mixture starts boiling again, stir in 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. If your soup looks too thin, add the flour and salt, then toss in those dried chili peppers for a gentle kick.

While that's simmering, grab a small bowl and mix together the yogurt with some crushed garlic. In a separate small pan, melt some butter and add a pinch of red pepper flakes - this will be your finishing touch.

When you're ready to serve, ladle the soup into bowls and top each one with a dollop of the garlic yogurt and a drizzle of that spiced butter.
