## Key Terms and Organizations

## Tax System Structure

The Ivorian tax system operates through a structured framework consisting of multiple taxation categories and administrative mechanisms. The system is designed to generate public revenue through various tax instruments while accommodating different business sizes and economic sectors.

The tax framework comprises:
- **Corporate income taxation** with scaled rates based on business size and industry classification
- **Value-added taxation** incorporating standard rates and specific exemptions for designated goods and technologies
- **Withholding tax mechanisms** applied across different income categories and transaction types
- **Social security contribution systems** administered through specialized agencies

The system has undergone digitization processes and administrative reforms aimed at enhancing collection efficiency and compliance mechanisms. Digital platforms have been implemented to facilitate tax filing, payment processing, and administrative communication between taxpayers and regulatory authorities.

### Tax Regime Classification

The Ivorian tax system operates four distinct tax regimes, each corresponding to specific business size categories based on annual turnover thresholds. Entity classification determines applicable tax rates, compliance obligations, and administrative requirements.

The four established regimes are:

1.  **Entrepreneur Regime (RE)** - applicable to micro-scale business operations and individual proprietors
2.  **Micro-enterprise Regime (RME)** - designated for entities with annual turnover between 50,000,001 and 200,000,000 CFA francs
3.  **Simplified Real Taxation Regime (RSI)** - intermediate classification with 27% BIC rate and simplified compliance procedures
4.  **Normal Real Taxation Regime (RNI)** - comprehensive regime for large-scale operations with 35% BIC rate and full regulatory requirements

#### **Entrepreneur Regime (RE)**

Established by the tax annex to Finance Law No. 2020-972 of December 23, 2020, for the 2021 state budget. This regime includes the Municipal Entrepreneur Tax (TCE) and the State Entrepreneur Tax (TEE). It's designed for very small businesses and sole proprietors.

#### **Micro-enterprise Regime (RME)**

According to Article 71 bis of the General Tax Code, micro-enterprises subject to tax are defined as natural or legal persons with annual turnover, including all taxes, between 50,000,001 francs and 200,000,000 CFA francs.

#### **Simplified Real Taxation Regime (RSI)**

The simplified regime or simplified real profit regime is an intermediate regime between the synthetic tax and the normal real profit tax. The BIC rate is 27%. Regardless of its tax result (loss or profit), the taxpayer is required to pay a minimum flat-rate tax corresponding to 0.5% of its turnover including tax with a minimum tax of 3 million CFA francs.

#### **Normal Real Taxation Regime (RNI)**

The taxable profit, different from the accounting profit, is established according to specific rules. The applied rate is 35%. Payment of tax by individuals at this rate is liberating from general income tax. Regardless of its tax result (loss or profit), the taxpayer is required to pay a minimum flat-rate tax corresponding to 0.5% of its turnover including tax with a minimum tax of 3 million and a maximum of 35 million CFA francs.

### Regulatory Authorities

The main regulatory authorities are the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI), responsible for tax policy and tax collection; the National Social Security Fund (CNPS), which supervises social security contributions and benefits; and the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), which manages health insurance and universal healthcare. Other regulatory bodies focus on specific sectors such as customs, public procurement, telecommunications, etc., ensuring compliance and oversight in their respective domains.

#### **Main Regulatory Authorities**

The main tax regulatory body is the **General Directorate of Taxes (DGI)**, responsible for tax policy formulation, administration, and collection of direct and indirect taxes, including corporate income tax, VAT, and personal income tax.

These measures specifically include provisions aimed at improving tax morality and strengthening state resources.

#### **2025 Tax Appendix - Latest Developments**

The 2025 Tax Appendix represents a significant step in Côte d'Ivoire's ongoing tax modernization efforts. Key highlights include:

**Legislative Progress:** The 2025 Tax Appendix was reviewed by the Economic and Financial Affairs Commission of the Ivorian National Assembly on November 18, 2024, and unanimously adopted on November 28, 2024. It was expected to be published in the Official Gazette in late December 2024, taking effect in early January 2025.

- Boosting government revenue collection
- Supporting business competitiveness 
- Tackling climate change through environmental taxation

**Key Reforms Include:**
- Revisions to withholding taxes on corporate income tax and VAT
- Mandatory electronic invoicing starting September 2025 (see my blog post [E-Invoice Migration guide](https://melik.cc/posts/einvoice-ivorycoast.html) for implementation specifics)
- Enhanced BIC reinvestment deduction incentives for businesses investing over 100 million CFA francs in Côte d'Ivoire

**Revenue Mobilization Strategy:** As part of the Medium-Term Revenue Mobilization Strategy for 2024–2028, the government aims to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by 0.5% annually through enhanced collection mechanisms.

## Tax Types

## Declarations/Tax Returns

Tax declarations are submitted after calculating respective taxes. Depending on the type of tax, declarations must be filed either through tax portals or manually with tax authorities.

### E-impôts Declarations

The DGI manages its own electronic tax portal, called e-impots. All taxes collected by the DGI must be declared through this portal. This portal integrates bank accounts, allowing automatic payments without having to enter other payment data.

### E-CNPS Declarations

CNPS and CNAM manage a tax portal called e-CNPS. All social security contributions collected by CNPS, including CNPS and CMU taxes, must be declared through this portal. This portal is integrated with different banks, allowing online payments via the online banking system.

### Other Declarations

Declarations to other institutions, such as DGMG, Abidjan District and CIAPOL, for taxes including extraction, advertising and environmental taxes, are submitted manually by the administrative department.

### Financial Statement Filing

Each year, financial statements must be filed in accordance with SYSCHOHADA accounting standards. These filings are made in digital form via the DGI's e-impot portal.

The main steps in preparing and presenting financial statements are presented below.

-   **Annual tax declarations**: Regulatory declarations, including mandatory declarations such as State 301 and State 302, as well as the intragroup declaration (ETII), must be completed in accordance with tax requirements.
-   **Finalization of accounting entries**: Complete all accounting entries, including stock movements, depreciation and amortization etc., and submit general ledgers and trial balance to the accounting director for approval.
-   **Audit**: Depending of tax regime, independent audit is an obligation. Necessary adjustments are made based on auditor findings.
-   **Draft preparation**: Draft financial statements are prepared and submitted to management for review at the annual general meeting.
-   **Electronic filing**: Financial statements, accompanied by necessary notes and annexes, are filed via e-impots. Once approved by the auditor on the portal, the financial statements are filed in digital form. The filed financial statements are then stored in the shared folder and sent to management.

## System Summary

The Ivorian tax system operates as a comprehensive regulatory framework encompassing multiple tax categories, administrative procedures, and compliance mechanisms. The system includes corporate income taxation, value-added taxation, withholding taxes, social security contributions, and various specialized levies administered through digital platforms and established regulatory procedures.

Recent legislative developments, including the 2025 Tax Appendix, have introduced modifications to existing tax provisions, electronic filing requirements, and compliance obligations. These regulatory changes reflect ongoing efforts to modernize tax administration and enhance revenue collection mechanisms within the established legal framework.
