Hi! I'm Melik, a financial controller living in the Ivory Coast. I've worked across West Africa and Turkey, mostly dealing with accounting and finance.

I like working with data, automating stuff, 3d printing and cooking. This site has some of my thoughts and recipes I've collected along the way.

## What's here

- **Blog posts** - mostly about data and work stuff
- **Recipes** - things I've tried and might get lost over time
- **Projects** - simple things I've built from what I learned along the way
