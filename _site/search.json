    "text": "Windows 11 and Its Issues\nWindows 11 has become more bloated than ever. Even with paid products such as Microsoft Office, you can’t escape automatic updates and more. Even with 16 GB of RAM, the OS doesn’t run smoothly due to the many background processes. For me, the last straw was Microsoft showing their AI products in every single place they can imagine, namely Copilot. I use Excel on a daily basis. One day, the Copilot icon started to pop up in every single cell. It was more than annoying. Later that day, I decided to use Linux as an alternative and ordered a separate SSD.\n\n\nThe Installation process\nSince I didn’t know if I would be able to use it, I decided to install it on a separate SSD by following this YouTube video. It was relatively easy. I backed up my disk before the installation as a safeguard measure.\nAfter I successfully installed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, without doing anything else, I installed Omakub. (Thank you DHH!) It worked like magic. Honestly, I was a bit surprised. I tried Linux in the early 2000s and 2010s. Back then, you had to babysit the OS and spend several hours in forums just to update your PC drivers.\nThe only caveat was installing the R packages. But I was able to find an amazing GitHub repo and forum post to resolve any issues.\n\n\nImpressions\nSo far, I’m very positive about my transition. The OS just works. No frills, no babysitting. Also, I’m learning new things about the Linux environment from the open source community. Compared to Windows 11, the system runs more quietly and consumes fewer resources, especially RAM usage. There are also privacy benefits of using Linux as well.\nI highly recommend trying Linux for everyday use. For those who need special software for their business, dual boot options are also available, which I use on a regular basis. Give it a try!"

    "section": "What is FNE",
    "text": "What is FNE\nFNE is the centralized e-invoice platform created by Ivorian tax authorities. All companies are subject to the obligation to issue standardized electronic invoices, regardless of their size or status, unless explicitly exempted by law.\nBased on a company’s legal status, issuing invoices through the platform is mandatory starting from 2025-06-01. All entities are expected to use the platform starting from 2025-09-01.\n\nHow it works\nAll entities must register on the FNE platform. Entities need to purchase electronic stamps on the FNE platform for document validation. Once a document is validated, a QR code will appear on it, and it will be sent to the buyer’s FNE inbox. There are three ways to issue a document:\n\nUsing FNE platform\nAuthorized billing terminals\nBilling systems interfaced with the FNE platform via an API.\n\nEntities may use one of these methods above to issue e-invoice or e-receipts.\n\nUsing FNE platform\nThe principal user who registered the platform can register new users with desired authorization levels, create establishments, points of sale, and nomenclature. Electronic stamps for document validation are purchased via the FNE platform.\nThere are several constraints I’ve observed so far when using the FNE platform:\n\nYou cannot register to different companies with same e-mail address.\nYou cannot save a document if you haven’t created point of sales.\nRegistered user can issue documents for only one establishment and one point of sales at a time.\nSaved documents cannot be deleted.\nYou cannot choose the document date; the date defaults to the invoice validation date with a full time stamp.\n\nSeveral VAT types are missing.\n\n\n\nAuthorized billing terminals\nFor small and micro-businesses subject to a flat-rate system, as well as for companies subject to a real tax system that use cash registers, it is planned to use TERNE3 for invoicing. This equipment will enable the issuance of standardized electronic receipts.\n\nElectronic payment terminal4\nMobile app of RNE5\n\nAs of 01/06/2025, there is no official publication of authorized vendors for electronic payment terminals or mobile applications.\n\n\nBilling systems interfaced with the FNE platform via an API\nTax authority published an technical API documentation for ERP integration. Companies are allowed to build their own solution via API key. However, as of 01/06/2025 there is no official agreed integration solution vendor published.\nSo far, I found only one vendor who offers ERP integration. Dexy Africa offers integration solution for ERP systems such as Sage, ODOO and Microsoft Dynamics 365."

When the mixture starts boiling again, stir in 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. If your soup looks too thin, add the flour and salt, then toss in those dried chili peppers for a gentle kick.\nWhile that’s simmering, grab a small bowl and mix together the yogurt with some crushed garlic. In a separate small pan, melt some butter and add a pinch of red pepper flakes - this will be your finishing touch.\nWhen you’re ready to serve, ladle the soup into bowls and top each one with a dollop of the garlic yogurt and a drizzle of that spiced butter."

When the halva, which thickens as it is mixed, reaches the desired consistency, remove it from the stove, crush it well in the sinis, spread it and cool it. The next day, it is blended with powdered sugar and a little salt to provide the desired sweetness and served in portions. If pistachios are to be added to the Tenem halva, they are added towards the end of the roasting process and roasted together, giving the halva a distinct appearance and flavor. Crushed cloves can also be added on top of the portions during serving."

    "section": "Tax System Structure",
    "text": "Tax System Structure\nThe Ivorian tax system operates through a structured framework consisting of multiple taxation categories and administrative mechanisms. The system is designed to generate public revenue through various tax instruments while accommodating different business sizes and economic sectors.\nThe tax framework comprises: - Corporate income taxation with scaled rates based on business size and industry classification - Value-added taxation incorporating standard rates and specific exemptions for designated goods and technologies - Withholding tax mechanisms applied across different income categories and transaction types - Social security contribution systems administered through specialized agencies\nThe system has undergone digitization processes and administrative reforms aimed at enhancing collection efficiency and compliance mechanisms. Digital platforms have been implemented to facilitate tax filing, payment processing, and administrative communication between taxpayers and regulatory authorities.\n\nTax Regime Classification\nThe Ivorian tax system operates four distinct tax regimes, each corresponding to specific business size categories based on annual turnover thresholds. Entity classification determines applicable tax rates, compliance obligations, and administrative requirements.\nThe four established regimes are:\n\nEntrepreneur Regime (RE) - applicable to micro-scale business operations and individual proprietors\nMicro-enterprise Regime (RME) - designated for entities with annual turnover between 50,000,001 and 200,000,000 CFA francs\nSimplified Real Taxation Regime (RSI) - intermediate classification with 27% BIC rate and simplified compliance procedures\nNormal Real Taxation Regime (RNI) - comprehensive regime for large-scale operations with 35% BIC rate and full regulatory requirements\n\n\nEntrepreneur Regime (RE)\nEstablished by the tax annex to Finance Law No. 2020-972 of December 23, 2020, for the 2021 state budget. This regime includes the Municipal Entrepreneur Tax (TCE) and the State Entrepreneur Tax (TEE). It’s designed for very small businesses and sole proprietors.\n\n\nMicro-enterprise Regime (RME)\nAccording to Article 71 bis of the General Tax Code, micro-enterprises subject to tax are defined as natural or legal persons with annual turnover, including all taxes, between 50,000,001 francs and 200,000,000 CFA francs.\n\n\nSimplified Real Taxation Regime (RSI)\nThe simplified regime or simplified real profit regime is an intermediate regime between the synthetic tax and the normal real profit tax. The BIC rate is 27%. Regardless of its tax result (loss or profit), the taxpayer is required to pay a minimum flat-rate tax corresponding to 0.5% of its turnover including tax with a minimum tax of 3 million CFA francs.\n\n\nNormal Real Taxation Regime (RNI)\nThe taxable profit, different from the accounting profit, is established according to specific rules. The applied rate is 35%. Payment of tax by individuals at this rate is liberating from general income tax. Regardless of its tax result (loss or profit), the taxpayer is required to pay a minimum flat-rate tax corresponding to 0.5% of its turnover including tax with a minimum tax of 3 million and a maximum of 35 million CFA francs.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Authorities\nThe main regulatory authorities are the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI), responsible for tax policy and tax collection; the National Social Security Fund (CNPS), which supervises social security contributions and benefits; and the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), which manages health insurance and universal healthcare. Other regulatory bodies focus on specific sectors such as customs, public procurement, telecommunications, etc., ensuring compliance and oversight in their respective domains.\n\nMain Regulatory Authorities\nThe main tax regulatory body is the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI), responsible for tax policy formulation, administration, and collection of direct and indirect taxes, including corporate income tax, VAT, and personal income tax.\nThe National Social Security Fund (CNPS) handles the management of social security contributions and ensures compliance with social insurance legislation.\nThe National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM) of Côte d’Ivoire is the national health insurance agency responsible for managing the country’s universal health coverage system.\n\n\nOther Authorities\nOther regulatory bodies (non-exhaustive) are mentioned below.\n\nGeneral Directorate of Mines and Geology (DGMG)\nGeneral Directorate of Customs (DGD)\nAbidjan District\nIvorian Anti-Pollution Center (CIAPOL)\nNational Environment Agency (ANDE)\nAgency for Employment Studies and Promotion (AGEPE)\nTelecommunications/ICT Regulatory Authority of Côte d’Ivoire (ARTCI)\n\n\n\n\nRecent Changes and Updates\nThe 2024 tax annex was structured mainly around the following axes:\n\nmeasures aimed at strengthening the state’s resource mobilization capacity;\nbusiness support measures;\nenvironmental taxation strengthening measures\n\nThese measures specifically include provisions aimed at improving tax morality and strengthening state resources.\n\n2025 Tax Appendix - Latest Developments\nThe 2025 Tax Appendix represents a significant step in Côte d’Ivoire’s ongoing tax modernization efforts. Key highlights include:\nLegislative Progress: The 2025 Tax Appendix was reviewed by the Economic and Financial Affairs Commission of the Ivorian National Assembly on November 18, 2024, and unanimously adopted on November 28, 2024. It was expected to be published in the Official Gazette in late December 2024, taking effect in early January 2025.\nStrategic Focus: The appendix focuses on three main objectives: - Boosting government revenue collection - Supporting business competitiveness - Tackling climate change through environmental taxation\nKey Reforms Include: - Revisions to withholding taxes on corporate income tax and VAT - Mandatory electronic invoicing starting September 2025 (see my blog post E-Invoice Migration guide for implementation specifics) - Enhanced BIC reinvestment deduction incentives for businesses investing over 100 million CFA francs in Côte d’Ivoire - Continued VAT exemptions for solar energy equipment to support environmental initiatives\nRevenue Mobilization Strategy: As part of the Medium-Term Revenue Mobilization Strategy for 2024–2028, the government aims to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by 0.5% annually through enhanced collection mechanisms."
